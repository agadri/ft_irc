    Command: KILL
    Parameters: <nickname> <comment>

    The KILL command is used to cause a client-server connection to be
    closed by the server which has the actual connection.  Servers
    generate KILL messages on nickname collisions.  It MAY also be
    available available to users who have the operator status.

    Clients which have automatic reconnect algorithms effectively make
    this command useless since the disconnection is only brief.  It does
    however break the flow of data and can be used to stop large amounts
    of 'flooding' from abusive users or accidents.  Abusive users usually
    don't care as they will reconnect promptly and resume their abusive
    behaviour.  To prevent this command from being abused, any user may
    elect to receive KILL messages generated for others to keep an 'eye'
    on would be trouble spots.

    In an arena where nicknames are REQUIRED to be globally unique at all
    times, KILL messages are sent whenever 'duplicates' are detected
    (that is an attempt to register two users with the same nickname) in
    the hope that both of them will disappear and only 1 reappear.

    When a client is removed as the result of a KILL message, the server
    SHOULD add the nickname to the list of unavailable nicknames in an
    attempt to avoid clients to reuse this name immediately which is
    usually the pattern of abusive behaviour often leading to useless
    "KILL loops".  See the "IRC Server Protocol" document [IRC-SERVER]
    for more information on this procedure.

    The comment given MUST reflect the actual reason for the KILL.  For
    server-generated KILLs it usually is made up of details concerning
    the origins of the two conflicting nicknames.  For users it is left
    up to them to provide an adequate reason to satisfy others who see
    it.  To prevent/discourage fake KILLs from being generated to hide
    the identify of the KILLer, the comment also shows a 'kill-path'
    which is updated by each server it passes through, each prepending
    its name to the path.

    NOTE:
    It is RECOMMENDED that only Operators be allowed to kill other users
    with KILL command.  This command has been the subject of many
    controversies over the years, and along with the above
    recommendation, it is also widely recognized that not even operators
    should be allowed to kill users on remote servers.
